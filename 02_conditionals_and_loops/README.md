# Exercise 02: Conditionals and Simple Loops

<!-- Generated by Copilot -->

## Theme: Weather Reporter

## Objective

Practice writing `if`/`elif`/`else` statements and iterating with simple `for`/`while` loops.

## Instructions

You are building small helpers for a basic weather app. Complete the functions in `weather.py` using conditionals and simple loops.

Implement these functions:

1. `temperature_feel(temp_c: int | float) -> str`
   - Return a label based on the Celsius temperature:
     - `"freezing"` for `temp_c <= 0`
     - `"cold"` for `1 <= temp_c <= 10`
     - `"mild"` for `11 <= temp_c <= 20`
     - `"warm"` for `21 <= temp_c <= 30`
     - `"hot"` for `temp_c > 30`

2. `count_rainy_days(forecast: list[str]) -> int`
   - Loop through the list and count how many entries equal `"rainy"` (case-insensitive).
   - Ignore other values like `"sunny"`, `"cloudy"`, etc.

3. `first_warm_day(temps: list[int | float]) -> int`
   - Return the index of the first day with a temperature strictly above `20`.
   - If there is no such day, return `-1`.

4. `sum_until_limit(numbers: list[int | float], limit: int | float) -> int | float`
   - Iterate through `numbers` and keep a running total.
   - Stop adding when the next number would push the total above `limit`.
   - Return the total that does not exceed `limit`.

## Example

- `temperature_feel(5)` -> `"cold"`
- `count_rainy_days(["Sunny", "Rainy", "RAINY"])` -> `2`
- `first_warm_day([10, 20, 22, 19])` -> `2`
- `sum_until_limit([4, 4, 10], 9)` -> `8`

## Required Knowledge: Conditionals

Use `if`/`elif`/`else` to run different code based on conditions. Comparisons: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`. Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.

### Example: using conditionals to assign grades based on score.
```python
score = 73
if score >= 85:
   grade = "A"
elif score >= 70:
   grade = "B"
elif score >= 55:
   grade = "C"
else:
   grade = "D"
```

## Required Knowledge: For Loops

Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges).

### Example: counting prices over a particular value
```python
prices = [5.0, 12.5, 3.0, 20.0]
count_over_10 = 0
for p in prices:
   if p > 10:
      count_over_10 += 1
```

### Example of iterating with range
```python

for i in range(3):
   print(i)  # 0, 1, 2
```

## Required Knowledge: While Loops

Use `while` loops when you repeat until a condition changes. Ensure something inside the loop updates the condition to avoid infinite loops.

### Example: saving money until reaching a goal

```python
goal = 100
saved = 0
deposit = 15
while saved + deposit <= goal:
   saved += deposit
```

## Running the Tests

```pwsh
pytest 02_conditionals_and_loops/test_weather.py -v
```

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass for `test_weather.py`.
- Your solutions use conditionals and loops as described.
