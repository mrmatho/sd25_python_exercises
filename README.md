# Software Development Python Exercises

These are a set of Python exercises to prepare you for Unit 3 & 4 Software Development. They cover the most important aspects of the Python language. 

## Structure

Each folder has a README file (with the instructions), an exercise file (a `.py` file) and a test file (a `.py` file that starts with test).  

You need to modify the exercise file, then use the test file to run your tests. Unless the tests passed: you didn't do it right.
