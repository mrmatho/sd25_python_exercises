# Exercise 03: Lists

<!-- Generated by Copilot -->

## Theme: Playlist Manager

## Objective

Practice working with lists including adding, removing, accessing, slicing, and manipulating list elements.

## Instructions

You are building a simple playlist manager. Complete the functions in `playlist.py` to perform various list operations.

Implement these functions:

1. `add_song(playlist: list[str], song: str) -> list[str]`
   - Add `song` to the end of the `playlist` and return the modified list.

2. `remove_song(playlist: list[str], song: str) -> list[str]`
   - Remove the first occurrence of `song` from the `playlist` (case-sensitive).
   - If the song is not found, return the playlist unchanged.
   - Return the modified list.

3. `get_song_at_position(playlist: list[str], position: int) -> str`
   - Return the song at the given `position` (0-indexed).
   - If the position is out of range, return `"Invalid position"`.

4. `get_first_three(playlist: list[str]) -> list[str]`
   - Return a new list containing only the first three songs.
   - If the playlist has fewer than three songs, return the entire playlist.

5. `reverse_playlist(playlist: list[str]) -> list[str]`
   - Return a new list with songs in reverse order.
   - Do not modify the original list.

6. `total_songs(playlist: list[str]) -> int`
   - Return the total number of songs in the playlist.

7. `contains_song(playlist: list[str], song: str) -> bool`
   - Return `True` if `song` is in the playlist (case-sensitive), `False` otherwise.

8. `combine_playlists(playlist1: list[str], playlist2: list[str]) -> list[str]`
   - Return a new list containing all songs from both playlists.

## Example

```python
songs = ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C"]
add_song(songs, "Song D")  # ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C", "Song D"]
remove_song(songs, "Song B")  # ["Song A", "Song C", "Song D"]
get_song_at_position(songs, 1)  # "Song C"
get_first_three(songs)  # ["Song A", "Song C", "Song D"]
reverse_playlist(songs)  # ["Song D", "Song C", "Song A"]
total_songs(songs)  # 3
contains_song(songs, "Song A")  # True
combine_playlists(["X"], ["Y", "Z"])  # ["X", "Y", "Z"]
```

## Required Knowledge: Lists

Lists are ordered collections that can hold multiple items. You can modify lists by adding or removing elements.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")  # Add to end
fruits.remove("banana")  # Remove first occurrence
```

## Required Knowledge: Indexing

Indexing allows you to access individual elements in a list using their position. Python uses **zero-based indexing**, meaning the first element is at index 0.

You can also use **negative indices** to count from the end of the list. `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` to the second-to-last, and so on.

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"]
first = colors[0]   # "red" - first element
second = colors[1]  # "green" - second element
last = colors[-1]   # "yellow" - last element
second_last = colors[-2]  # "blue" - second-to-last element
```

## Required Knowledge: Slicing

Slicing allows you to extract a portion of a list by specifying a start and end index. The syntax is `list[start:end]`, where `start` is inclusive and `end` is exclusive.

You can omit `start` to begin from the beginning, or omit `end` to go to the end. You can also use a step value with `list[start:end:step]`.

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"]
first_two = colors[0:2]   # ["red", "green"] - elements 0 and 1
first_three = colors[:3]  # ["red", "green", "blue"] - start omitted
last_two = colors[3:]     # ["yellow", "purple"] - end omitted
reversed_list = colors[::-1]  # ["purple", "yellow", "blue", "green", "red"] - step of -1 reverses
```

## Required Knowledge: Common List Operations

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]
length = len(items)  # 3
is_present = 2 in items  # True
combined = items + [4, 5]  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_items = items[::-1]  # [3, 2, 1]
```

- To count the number of elements in a list, use `len()`.
- To check if an element exists in a list, use the `in` keyword.
- To combine two lists, use the `+` operator.
- To reverse a list, you can use slicing with `[::-1]`.

## Running the Tests

```pwsh
pytest 03_lists/test_playlist.py -v
```

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass for `test_playlist.py`.
- Your solutions use appropriate list methods and operations.
